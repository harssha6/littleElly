I am especially happy about the focus given to extracurricular activities and the bond between teachers and children. I always find that she looks forward to school every morning. Sometimes she even wakes up and gets ready before I go to wake her up. Viaani will surely miss Little Elly when she moves schools after UKG.'

After he started coming to Little Elly I noticed a lot of growth in him. He was able to mingle with other children and adapted well. He is now very social and tries to make friends and interact with more people. I am very happy with Little Elly.'

Although Pragathi was in school in Cochin, she was only really able to speak our mother tongue. After some research from my end, she joined Little Elly for Playgroup. The Centre head and the teachers were all very welcoming. I felt safe. Pragathi has now made a lot of progress, especially with her language and vocabulary which I can see has improved tremendously.'
