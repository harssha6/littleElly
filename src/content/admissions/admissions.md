        title: I am glad I chose Little Elly because
        quote: it has made my Riaan more social and confident.
        description: >-
          Being a child that was born during the COVID-19 lockdown he was
          indoors for a very long time which was worrying for us because he
          would not talk to anyone and was very shy. After he started coming to
          Little Elly I noticed a lot of growth in him. He was able to mingle
          with other children and adapted well. He is now very social and tries
          to make friends and interact with more people. I am very happy with
          Little Elly.

          We extend profound gratitude to Little Elly School for nurturing our
          daughter, Priyanshi, and fostering a supportive environment from her
          first day. Engaging in extracurricular activities, she learned the
          significance of teamwork and leadership. The safe, inclusive
          atmosphere empowered her to express herself freely, creating a second
          home where she felt valued. We wholeheartedly recommend Little Elly
          School for its enriching educational experience.

          this is Aylin Shaila’s first step to schooling and we didn’t want to
          make a mistake.
        description: >-
          We were looking for the best preschool in the area. We visited about
          3-4 schools and were most happy with Little Elly Indiranagar. Aileen
          was not at all social and this was a major worry for us. She is very
          shy and was born during the pandemic which meant she didn’t get to
          mingle with other people very much. After coming to Little Elly there
          has been a great change. Our daily and friends have also pointed out
          to us that there is a visible change.

        quote: ' Agastya is happier in school than he is at home and that is saying something…'
        description: >-
          Agastya moved to Little Elly in the middle of the academic year. To
          our surprise, he had fully settled in two days. He loves his Raaji
          Ma’am and we really like the preschool program and the activities.
          Since both of us work long days he is in school for most of the day as
          he stays back for daycare. We were skeptical about leaving him here
          for long hours but he seems to be happier here than at home.
