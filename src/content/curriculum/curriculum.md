    descriptionTop: "A child's inherent intelligence isn't determined by the number of brain cells they're born with, but rather by the connections formed between those cells. These connections,\_**crucial for cognitive development**, are cultivated through the experiences and stimuli provided in the early years.\n"
    descriptionLeft: "The H.A.P.P.Y curriculum takes a unique approach to nurturing these connections by creating a diverse and engaging environment that stimulates various aspects of a child's brain. It is a\_**handpicked blend of renowned educational methodologies**\_and incorporates diverse perspectives and methodologies. Caregivers and educators provide \_**multifaceted environment**\_that encourages exploration, critical thinking, and curiosity, laying the groundwork for a child's holistic development.\n"

        description: >-
          The primary focus of the curriculum is to stimulate your child's
          mental development. We place significant emphasis on addressing the
          crucial issue of proper nutrition for children through regularly
          updated booklets and other resources.
      - title: Acute Senses
        description: >-
          A child learns through his five acute senses. So, it is vital to build
          strong senses to enable him to learn successfully. The H.A.P.P.Y
          curriculum includes eye–tracking skills, early musical skills,
          listening skills, and physical “motor skills” such as finger and thumb
          control.
      - title: Practical Life Skills
        description: >-
          Teaching practical life skills to children is crucial for their
          holistic development and the cultivation of independence. These skills
          equip children with essential abilities for daily living and create
          the groundwork for lifelong learning and success.
      - title: Purposeful Fun
        description: >-
          The H.A.P.P.Y Curriculum is centred around engaging games and
          activities, each designed with a specific purpose. While these
          activities are enjoyable, they play a crucial role in fostering a
          child's physical, emotional, or intellectual development.
      - title: Yay! Approach
        description: >-
          The H.A.P.P.Y curriculum embraces the infectious enthusiasm of young
          learners who approach each day with excitement and eagerness to
          explore and achieve. We aim to ignite and nurture this natural
          curiosity by creating a vibrant atmosphere of enthusiasm that fuels
          their learning and development during these crucial early years of
          childhood.

      At Little Elly we firmly believe in tailoring the educational experience
      to suit each child's individual needs. We adopt a combination of
      philosophies and take a unique approach that aligns with the values and
      goals of our parents and the needs of our children.
    list:
      - title: Gardner Approach
        description: >-
          Howard Gardner proposed the theory of multiple intelligences which
          differentiates human intelligence into specific modalities.
      - title: Montessori Approach
        description: >-
          Maria Montessori's kinesthetic educational model allows the child to
          pursue their independence and individual interests.
      - title: Waldorf Approach
        description: >-
          'The Waldorf Approach focuses on nurturing children's overall
          development by integrating arts, nature, and age-appropriate learning
          experiences.
      - title: Bloom Approach
        description: >-
          Benjamin Bloom's Taxonomy is a set of 3 hierarchical models:
          cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains.
      - title: Learning style theory
        description: >-
          Individuals have distinct preferred methods for absorbing and
          processing information that impacts their educational experiences and
          results.
montessoriApproach:
  - title: Montessori Approach
    description: "The H.A.P.P.Y Curriculum applies the\_**Montessori approach** through the implementation of self-directed learning, independence and hands-on exploration. Each Little Elly centre has a motor skills room dedicated to introducing children to work in an independent Montessori environment. This is a prepared environment that is conducive to learning. Children are exposed to a variety of practical and sensory materials to promote\_**hands-on learning and discovery**.\n\n\\<br/>\n\nOur teachers observe each child's interests, strengths and needs to tailor instruction accordingly. Children are provided with the freedom to express and pursue their interests. This aligns with the Montessori approach in a way that each child is respected and valued in a supportive environment.\n"

    description: "The\_**Waldorf approach**\_mainly focuses on holistic development. This is deeply rooted in the H.A.P.P.Y curriculum wherein a theme is chosen each month and these themes and concepts dictate each month's activities. Children are exposed to natural materials and a lot of imaginative play throughout the month. A nurturing environment is created where children are provided with means for artistic expression through rhythm, music, movement and routines.\n\n\\<br/>\n\nLittle Elly also strongly encourages reading as a habit and prioritises storytime and oral recitations which are endorsed strongly by the Waldorf approach. Teachers often tell stories in our\_**reading corner orally**\_or through puppetry in our dedicated puppet theatre using rich language and imagery to engage children’s imagination.\n"

gardnerApproach:
  - title: Gardner Approach
    description: "**Howard Gardner's**\_theory of multiple intelligences suggests that individuals have different types of intelligences, and these should be recognized and nurtured in education. The H.A.P.P.Y curriculum recognises that intelligence is not a singular trait but is a collection of different bits of intelligence.\n\n\\<br/>\n\nAll the age-appropriate activities designed at Little Elly are created keeping the 8 unique intelligences in mind ranging from musical to interpersonal. The child is then observed to understand how they process the information provided to them and how they\_**interact with the world around them**.\n"

  - title: Bloom Approach
    descriptionTop: >
      Bloom’s Taxonomy is a powerful tool that ensures that the H.A.P.P.Y
      Curriculum is well-rounded. Through its implementation, we ensure that
      children are engaged in activities that target different levels of
      thinking and not just memorization. This approach classifies learning
      objectives into three major domains:
    descriptionlist:
      - title: Psychomotor
        description: Involves practical skills and coordination.
      - title: Affective
        description: 'Deals with emotions, attitudes and values'
      - title: Cognitive
        description: 'Deals with remembering, understanding and applying knowledge'
    descriptionBottom: >
      The H.A.P.PY curriculum is most concerned with the Cognitive aspect and it
      is actively considered in our process of Evaluation and Assessment. As
      preschoolers are still in an early development stage, we at Little Elly
      focus on creating a fun and engaging learning environment that uses a
      variety of activities to target all levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.

  - title: Learning Style Theory
    description: "Applying the\_**Learning style theory**\_to the H.A.P.P.Y Curriculum helps us recognise how each child is best able to absorb information. According to the theory Learning Styles are broadly categorized into 4 learning styles:\_**Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic and Written**.\n\n\\<br/>\n\nAt Little Elly, our main focus is on identifying how each child prefers to absorb information. Our teachers accommodate a flexible approach to their instruction to accommodate all the different kinds of learners thus creating a more inclusive and effective learning environment where children of diverse learning styles can thrive.\n"
