                  It is the aim of all parents to find the right school for
                  their child, preferably a home away from home, one that takes
                  care of the child’s learning and also equips them with life
                  skills in their overall development. We at “Little Elly”
                  Arekere strongly believe in what Bill Gates once famously
                  said, “The first five years have so much to do with how the
                  next 80 turn out.” Research shows that the first five years of
                  childhood are the most formative and incredible learning with
                  vital mental and cognitive development occurs during this
                  period. The role and importance of early childhood education
                  in shaping our lives cannot be understated.


                  Beyond the A, B, C and rhymes, this phase is equally important
                  for the all-round development of the child. Our programs are
                  tailor-made to foster every child’s emotional, intellectual
                  and aesthetic quotient. Started in 2008, “Little Elly” Arekere
                  has been one of the best preschools in this locality and the
                  distinguishing feature which sets us apart is our staff, who
                  have been associated with us for more than a decade. We
                  nurture warm relationships among Children, Teachers, Staff and
                  Parents. Teachers and staff build a close rapport with each
                  and every child under their wing.

                  order to build a solid foundation for lifelong learning. We

                  by the environment and the people that surround them.


                  We acknowledge this through our curriculum/programs which are
                  well researched and age-appropriate. Along with a team of
                  dedicated staff, we focus on a sound early education that has
                  the possibility to caring, capable and responsible future

                  field of “Early Childcare and Development”.


                  Mrs. Ekta Mitra started her career as a lecturer and being a
                  mom who thoroughly enjoyed the company of her kids, soon took

                  Childhood Education” and “Counselling” in Canada. She also won

                  It is the aim of every parent to find the right school for
                  their child, preferably a home away from home, one that takes
                  care of the child’s learning, equips them with life skills as
                  well as helps them in their overall development. We at “Little
                  Elly” Arekere strongly believe in what Bill Gates once
                  famously said, “The first five years have so much to do with
                  how the next 80 turn out.” Research shows that the first five
                  years of childhood are the most formative and incredible
                  learning period during which vital mental and cognitive
                  development occurs.


                  The role and importance of early childhood education in
                  shaping our lives cannot be understated. Beyond the ABCD and
                  rhymes this phase is equally important for the all-round
                  development of the child. Our programs are tailor-made to
                  foster every child’s emotional, intellectual and aesthetic
                  quotient. Started in 2008, “Little Elly” Arekere has been one
                  of the best preschools in this locality and the distinguishing
                  feature which sets us apart is our staff, who have been
                  associated with us for more than a decade. We nurture warm
                  relationships among Children, Teachers, Staff and Parents.
                  Teachers and staff build a close personal connection with each
                  child in their care.

                  results.Because of this and my varied experience of providing

                  My passion towards education and my affection for kids made me
                  start a preschool. I prioritize by giving the safest and the
                  best learning environment to our little ones, which keeps the
                  parents stress-free. In love with the innocence of kids, I

                  learning fun.

              Shivangi Singh holds an MBA degree in International Business in HR
              and B.ed. While Shivangi started her career as an air hostess, her
              love for educating kids especially in remote places drive her to
              the teaching profession. Shivangi has worked as a teacher for
              preschool and primary school kids in a few schools. While teaching
              gave her a lot of satisfaction she always felt that the foundation
              in North Karnataka schools lacked quality. Being mother of two
              young boys, her fears and understanding were reconfirmed when they
              started going to school. She started thinking how it can be made
              better and evaluated the syllabus of many of the professional
              chain of preschools and finally decided to set up Little Elly
              preschool in Bagalkot looking at their excellent curriculum and
              fantastic support from the founders and the staff. Little Elly
              matched her vision to providing quality education like some of the
              best preschools in metros at affordable fees.


              She is passionate about education, working with kids,
              understanding their needs and continuously improving it. She
              understands what exactly the kids in this region need, being
              mother of two young boys.


              Shivangi is a creative person who has a lot of interest in arts
              and crafts, live music and also loves to travel.

                  My name is Debjani and I come with an experience of over 13
                  years in pre-primary education. I am also a skilled Indian
                  Classical dancer with a number of stage performances to my
                  credit. I’ve always felt driven to be a pre-primary school
                  educator and it gives me a great sense of pride to be able to
                  facilitate the growth and development of young children. I am
                  extremely passionate and continuously look forward to honing
                  my teaching skills as I work with young minds at school. It is
                  this passion and enthusiasm that has motivated me to build my
                  own set up at Little Elly Wagholi. Through this new setup of
                  ours, I will strive to bring out the best of my experience and
                  abilities and be able to act as a guiding light for the little
                  ones.

                  Every child should be educated, happy and most importantly
                  loved. Jyoti has always felt very strongly about that. While
                  working out of India she assisted in schools whenever she had
                  some time free from her actual job and that is where her
                  passion for teaching in a fun way came about.


                  Making sure that every child is learning, happy and safe in
                  the preschool space is of utmost importance to her. She
                  believes Little Elly provides all of that and more.
