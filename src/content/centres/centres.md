                  It is the aim of all parents to find the right school for
                  their child, preferably a home away from home, one that takes
                  care of the child’s learning and also equips them with life
                  skills in their overall development. We at “Little Elly”
                  Arekere strongly believe in what Bill Gates once famously
                  said, “The first five years have so much to do with how the
                  next 80 turn out.” Research shows that the first five years of
                  childhood are the most formative and incredible learning with
                  vital mental and cognitive development occurs during this
                  period. The role and importance of early childhood education
                  in shaping our lives cannot be understated.


                  Beyond the A, B, C and rhymes, this phase is equally important
                  for the all-round development of the child. Our programs are

                  “Little Elly” Noble Residency Centre, is built around the
                  strong belief that the childhood of a little one is precious.
                  It is meant to be enjoyed and cherished. Research and in-depth
                  studies have proven that the first five years of childhood are
                  the most formative. Incredible learning and vital mental and
                  cognitive growth occurs during this period.


                  In these years, the child has an outstanding ability to imbibe
                  and flourish at a fascinating pace. Our programs are tailored
                  to foster every child’s social, aesthetic and motor skills. We
                  develop age-appropriate activity based learning for the
                  child’s all round development.

                  students for more than a decade.


                  In my experience I have learnt that the earlier a holistic
                  approach to a child’s education is undertaken, the better the
                  results.Because of this and my varied experience of providing

                  with Little Elly to provide top notch education to pre nursery

                  Rashmi, Centre Head of Little Elly, RR Nagar, with an M.Sc.
                  and B.Ed. degree, worked in ICSE and CBSE boards with an
                  experience of more than 15 years.


                  My passion towards education and my affection for kids made me
                  start a preschool. I prioritize by giving the safest and the
                  best learning environment to our little ones, which keeps the
                  parents stress-free. In love with the innocence of kids, I
                  focus on a child's needs, their uniqueness, comfort, and make
                  learning fun.


                  My Goal is to make the journey of our little ones be the best
                  and fun-filled.

                  I'm a B.E graduate. My passion and love for kids to build a
                  bright future made me give up my IT profession.


                  I feel fun-activity based learning is one of the best ways to
                  teach our little ones in a safe learning environment where
                  there is equal opportunity for all, so that the kids get
                  pro-actively perfect on what they are learning.


                  I also believe that Every kid is a one-of-a-kind superstar by
                  unleashing their inner awesomeness and helping them shine.

              Shivangi Singh holds an MBA degree in International Business in HR
              and B.ed. While Shivangi started her career as an air hostess, her
              love for educating kids especially in remote places drive her to
              the teaching profession. Shivangi has worked as a teacher for
              preschool and primary school kids in a few schools. While teaching
              gave her a lot of satisfaction she always felt that the foundation
              in North Karnataka schools lacked quality. Being mother of two
              young boys, her fears and understanding were reconfirmed when they
              started going to school. She started thinking how it can be made
              better and evaluated the syllabus of many of the professional
              chain of preschools and finally decided to set up Little Elly
              preschool in Bagalkot looking at their excellent curriculum and
              fantastic support from the founders and the staff. Little Elly
              matched her vision to providing quality education like some of the
              best preschools in metros at affordable fees.


              She is passionate about education, working with kids,
              understanding their needs and continuously improving it. She
              understands what exactly the kids in this region need, being
              mother of two young boys.


              Shivangi is a creative person who has a lot of interest in arts
              and crafts, live music and also loves to travel.

              Montessori methodology at Tirupati. Our vision is to provide each
              child with proper guidance to grow in his/her own way, in a
              mutually accepting and nurturing environment. We believe in making
              teaching and learning a harmonious process. It is an organization
              which fosters strong skills and an everlasting passion for
              learning as the child grows and is ready to take on the challenges
              of grade school.

              “Little Elly” IIT- Tirupathi, was established in the year 2014 at
              Padmavathi Puram. It was the first center to start and practice
              Montessori methodology at Tirupati. Our vision is to provide each
              child with proper guidance to grow in his/her own way, in a

              learning as the child grows and is ready to take on the challenges
              of grade school.

                  My name is Debjani and I come with an experience of over 13
                  years in pre-primary education. I am also a skilled Indian
                  Classical dancer with a number of stage performances to my
                  credit. I’ve always felt driven to be a pre-primary school
                  educator and it gives me a great sense of pride to be able to
                  facilitate the growth and development of young children. I am
                  extremely passionate and continuously look forward to honing
                  my teaching skills as I work with young minds at school. It is
                  this passion and enthusiasm that has motivated me to build my
                  own set up at Little Elly Wagholi. Through this new setup of
                  ours, I will strive to bring out the best of my experience and
                  abilities and be able to act as a guiding light for the little
                  ones.

                  some time free from her actual job and that is where her
                  passion for teaching in a fun way came about.


                  Making sure that every child is learning, happy and safe in
                  the preschool space is of utmost importance to her. She
                  believes Little Elly provides all of that and more.
