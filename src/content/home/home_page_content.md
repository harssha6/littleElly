          The significance of providing stimulation during the early years of a
          child's life is sometimes significantly undervalued. This is when your
          child is most receptive and malleable, with their brain developing
          over 90%. This period is marked by a continuous evolution of
          intellectual curiosity, rendering it the most influential and
          <span>defining phase in your child's life.</span>

These connections,\_**crucial for cognitive development**, are cultivated through the experiences and stimuli provided in the early years.\n"

It is a\_**handpicked blend of renowned educational methodologies**\_and incorporates diverse perspectives and methodologies.

          The primary focus of the curriculum is to stimulate your child's
          mental development. We place significant emphasis on addressing the
          crucial issue of proper nutrition for children through regularly
          updated booklets and other resources.
      - title: Acute Senses
        description: >-
          A child learns through his five acute senses. So, it is vital to build
          strong senses to enable him to learn successfully. The H.A.P.P.Y
          curriculum includes eye–tracking skills, early musical skills,
          listening skills, and physical “motor skills” such as finger and thumb
          control.
      - title: Practical Life Skills
        description: >-
          Teaching practical life skills to children is crucial for their
          holistic development and the cultivation of independence. These skills
          equip children with essential abilities for daily living and create
          the groundwork for lifelong learning and success.
      - title: Purposeful Fun
        description: >-
          The H.A.P.P.Y Curriculum is centred around engaging games and
          activities, each designed with a specific purpose. While these
          activities are enjoyable, they play a crucial role in fostering a
          child's physical, emotional, or intellectual development.

        description: >-
          The H.A.P.P.Y curriculum embraces the infectious enthusiasm of young
          learners who approach each day with excitement and eagerness to
          explore and achieve. We aim to ignite and nurture this natural
          curiosity by creating a vibrant atmosphere of enthusiasm that fuels
          their learning and development during these crucial early years of
          childhood.

        quote: it has made my Riaan more social and confident.
        description: >-
          Being a child that was born during the COVID-19 lockdown he was
          indoors for a very long time which was worrying for us because he
          would not talk to anyone and was very shy. After he started coming to
          Little Elly I noticed a lot of growth in him. He was able to mingle
          with other children and adapted well. He is now very social and tries
          to make friends and interact with more people. I am very happy with
          Little Elly.

          We extend profound gratitude to Little Elly School for nurturing our
          daughter, Priyanshi, and fostering a supportive environment from her
          first day. Engaging in extracurricular activities, she learned the
          significance of teamwork and leadership. The safe, inclusive
          atmosphere empowered her to express herself freely, creating a second
          home where she felt valued. We wholeheartedly recommend Little Elly
          School for its enriching educational experience.

          mistake.
        description: >-
          We were looking for the best preschool in the area. We visited about
          3-4 schools and were most happy with Little Elly Indiranagar. Aileen
          was not at all social and this was a major worry for us. She is very
          shy and was born during the pandemic which meant she didn’t get to
          mingle with other people very much. After coming to Little Elly there
          has been a great change. Our daily and friends have also pointed out
          to us that there is a visible change.

        description: >-
          Agastya moved to Little Elly in the middle of the academic year. To
          our surprise, he had fully settled in two days. He loves his Raaji
          Ma’am and we really like the preschool program and the activities.
          Since both of us work long days he is in school for most of the day as
          he stays back for daycare. We were skeptical about leaving him here
          for long hours but he seems to be happier here than at home.
